===== KYC Chain Comprehensive Test Suite =====

--- Scenario 1: Happy path, multi-customers, multi-tx blocks ---
  PASS: Chain validates after multi-tx batching
  PASS: Audit for Cust2 returns 4 transactions

--- Scenario 2: Impersonation fails (signer != bankId) ---
  PASS: Validation fails because signer name does not match declared bankId

--- Scenario 3: In-chain payload tamper is detected ---
  PASS: Chain valid prior to tamper
  PASS: Validation fails after payload tamper inside a mined block

--- Scenario 4: Signature swap attack is detected ---
  PASS: Chain valid before signature swap
  PASS: Validation fails after signature swap (signatures are bound to canonical data)

--- Scenario 5: Replay detection by audit ---
  PASS: Chain remains valid cryptographically with a replayed tx
  PASS: Audit detects duplicate txId (replay) even though PoW and signatures are intact

--- Scenario 6: Difficulty and link assertions ---
  PASS: Baseline validity
  PASS: All non-genesis blocks satisfy link and hash-prefix constraints

--- Scenario 8: Rebuild chain from existing txs ---
  PASS: Original chain valid
  PASS: Rebuilt chain also validates with same tx objects

--- Scenario 9: Re-mining cannot fix broken signatures ---
  PASS: Baseline valid prior to tamper
  PASS: Even after re-mining, invalid signature keeps chain invalid

--- Scenario 10: Latency micro-benchmarks ---
  PASS: Benchmark chain valid at difficulty 2
  Difficulty 2: avg=0ms p50=0ms p90=2ms p99=3ms (N=30)
  PASS: Benchmark chain valid at difficulty 3
  Difficulty 3: avg=14ms p50=13ms p90=28ms p99=35ms (N=20)

--- Scenario 11: AI attestation end-to-end ---
  PASS: Chain valid with AI-assisted verification
  PASS: Verify tx carries model id/version
  PASS: Verify tx binds to attestation hash
  PASS: Off-chain attestation retrievable by hash
  PASS: Registry accepts attestation signature and model binding
  PASS: Different attestation content produces a different hash
  PASS: Changing a signed field in the verify tx invalidates the chain
