KYC Blockchain Demo — Deep Dive (Humanized)

This project shows, in plain terms, how KYC can ride on a lightweight blockchain to guarantee integrity and provenance—without ever putting someone’s passport photo or address on-chain. It’s small enough to read in an afternoon, but it tackles real concerns: cryptographic signatures, stable canonical data, proof-of-work, audit trails, and a practical AI attestation that’s verifiable off-chain.

The Story in One Pass

A customer submits KYC documents. Instead of storing the raw files on a blockchain, we hash them (SHA-256) and record just that hash plus a pointer to where the real files live. A bank reviews the submission and publishes a signed verification. If the bank used an AI pre-screen, the verification also records the model’s id/version and the hash of the AI service’s signed attestation. Finally, the bank shares this verified “KYC stamp” with a relying institution. Every step is signed; every block is mined; any change breaks the chain.

How the Code Is Organized

Main.java is the living spec. It runs eleven scenarios: happy path, impersonation attempts, payload tampering, signature swaps, replay detection, fuzzing, rebuilds, re-mining, performance checks, and the AI path. Each prints a single PASS/FAIL line so the outcome is unambiguous.

The core folder houses two pieces. Blockchain is the minimal consensus layer: chained blocks, adjustable proof-of-work, and straightforward validation. KYCService is the domain façade that creates transactions, collects signatures, orchestrates the flow, and—if the AI module is enabled—verifies the attestation and binds its hash into the bank’s verification.

The model folder defines the vocabulary. Block is a mined container of transactions. Participant is a named actor with a role and an ECDSA keypair. Under tx/ you’ll find the base transaction class (canonicalization + signing) and the three concrete actions that make up the KYC protocol: upload, verify, and share.

The ai folder mirrors how many teams work in practice: an off-chain ML service pre-screens documents and returns a signed attestation. Attestation captures model id/version, input fingerprint, risk score, flags, timestamp, and a signature. ModelRegistry is a simple allow-list mapping model versions to public keys. SimpleKycAIService generates deterministic, signed attestations so you can focus on the signature and binding flow, not model training.

The Transaction Flow

Upload starts with the customer. We compute a hash of the raw KYC payload, keep the raw data off-chain, and publish a KYC_UPLOAD containing the customer id, hash, pointer, and the customer’s signature over canonical data.

Verify happens at the bank. If the bank consults the AI service, the AI returns a signed attestation. We verify that signature against the registry, then publish a KYC_VERIFY that includes the decision and binds to the attestation via its hash. The bank signs the entire verification payload, so changing the model id/version or the attestation hash later will break the signature.

Share is the handoff. The bank publishes a KYC_SHARE that points to the verify transaction and names the recipient institution, signed by the bank.

Canonical Strings and Signatures

Every transaction reduces to a stable, delimiter-based string that includes all fields that matter for trust. We sign that string together with the signer’s public key to prevent key-swap tricks. Validation recomputes the canonical data and verifies the signature using the embedded public key. Because domain-specific fields (like model id/version and attestation hash) are included, even a one-character tweak is detectable.

Blocks, Mining, and Validation

Each block carries an index, timestamp, previous hash, nonce, and transactions. Mining increments the nonce until the block hash has the required number of leading zeros. Validation re-hashes the block, checks the difficulty prefix, and verifies the previous-hash link. Re-mining cannot “fix” a forged transaction—signatures still fail—so integrity holds.

Validation runs on three layers:

Link + PoW: previous hash matches, recomputed hash equals stored hash, difficulty prefix holds.

Signatures: every transaction verifies under its signer’s public key and canonical data.

Domain rules: signer identity must match the declared entity (e.g., bankId on a verification must be the actual signer).

AI Attestation, Kept Private

The AI service lives off-chain. It returns a signed attestation; the chain records only its hash plus model id/version. Later, an auditor can retrieve the attestation separately, re-hash it, check the signature against the registry’s public key, and confirm that the bank’s decision referenced this exact artifact—without exposing any private content on-chain.

Auditing and Replays

Audits are by customer id and list uploads, verifications, and shares in order. Replaying a transaction id is visible to auditors even if the chain remains cryptographically valid. You can keep replay detection as an audit concern (as shown) or promote it to a consensus rule in your own variant.

Threats and Defenses

Payload tampering is caught by signature checks. Impersonation (BankB signing while claiming to be BankA) is rejected by domain rules. Signature swaps across independent transactions fail because signatures bind to canonical payloads. Re-mining doesn’t help after tamper. Attestation mismatches are exposed by the on-chain hash and the registry’s allow-list.

Cost and Performance Signals

Difficulty is tunable so you can see latency trade-offs on your machine. Micro-benchmarks print average and tail mining times. Transactions are tiny canonical strings; signature checks are constant time. No external services are required, which keeps reasoning simple.

What Lives On-Chain (and What Doesn’t)

On-chain: transaction headers, hashes, signatures, signer public keys, and the minimal references you need—pointers to off-chain KYC data and the hash of an AI attestation. Off-chain: the raw KYC payload and the attestation JSON. This split keeps the chain lean and the privacy surface small.

Tests With a Purpose

The scenarios aren’t theater; they prove properties:

Scaling across customers and multi-tx blocks.

Impersonation blocked.

Payload tamper and signature swaps detected.

Replays visible to audit.

Rebuilds validate, proving signatures don’t depend on block metadata.

Re-mining can’t mask bad signatures.

Benchmarks quantify mining cost.

AI decisions are tied to signed, verifiable artifacts.

Each prints a one-line assertion so reviewers can follow the logic without digging through code.

Where to Take It Next

Persist attestations and the model registry (file or DB) for cross-process auditing.

Add Merkle roots to block headers for explicit inclusion proofs.

Enforce roles in KYCService (only banks verify; only origin bank shares).

Expose a small REST API to submit txs and run audits.

If your policy demands it, make replay prevention a consensus rule.

Why This Approach Works in Practice

It respects privacy by design, keeps the chain minimal, and still answers the forensic questions: who did what, when, using which evidence. It records that a particular AI model and version influenced a decision without dragging ML internals onto the chain. And because the mechanics are visible—canonicalization, signatures, proof-of-work—you can audit the system and explain it to non-engineers with confidence.

How to Read It

Have ten minutes? Run it and skim the scenario output. Have thirty? Read Main.java, then Blockchain.java and KYCService.java. Ready for details? Open the transaction classes to see how canonical strings are formed and signed, then visit the AI module to understand attestation verification and binding.

In short: small on ceremony, strong on concepts, and built to show how integrity, provenance, and privacy can coexist in a KYC workflow.
